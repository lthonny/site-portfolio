# sitePortfolio 

**This site was my internship test assignment.**

### This project contains the following files and folders:
- main file index.html
- the src folder in which the following folders are stored
- the css folder kept the entire style of the site
- img folder stored photo content
- js folder for storing scripts and site animation
- the scss folder contains all the style files, which are later translated into the css folder



## To use the preprocessor SCSS
I used the vs code plugin which translated the sass syntax into css and put the code in the css folder.
To start using it, let's go to the vs code extension:

    -go to vs code and go to extensions
    -in the search box, write Live Sass Compiler
    -click install
