# sitePortfolio 

**This site was my internship test assignment.**

### Technologies used
- sass preprocessor
- Google Fonts fonts
- Fontawesome icons
- jquery library
- For the progress Bar animation, I used the library
- animate.css library
- wow library for motion animation
- Query-circle-progress 
- Bootstrap
- tried to use the syntax of the BEM methodology, but it did not work for me (

### This project contains the following files and folders:
- main file index.html
- the src folder in which the following folders are stored
- the css folder kept the entire style of the site
- img folder stored photo content
- js folder for storing scripts and site animation
- the scss folder contains all the style files, which are later translated into the css folder

### Installation of technologies
- Google Fonts <https://fonts.google.com/>
- Fontawesome <https://fontawesome.com/>
- Jquery cdn <https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery>
- Animate.css <https://animate.style/#utilities>
- WoW cdn <https://cdnjs.com/libraries/wow>
- Sass <https://sass-lang.com/>
- Bootstrap cdn <https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/>
- Jquery-circle-progress cdn <https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-circle-progress>

### To use the preprocessor SCSS
I used the vs code plugin which translated the sass syntax into css and put the code in the css folder.
To start using it, let's go to the vs code extension:

- go to vs code and go to extensions
- in the search box, write Live Sass Compiler
- click install
